# win_sock

Let's start the socket test on Windows~ (You may suffer from the problem of "Ws2_32.lib" loss or else, but it's easy to solve, just Google it!)

- Build client.exe & server.exe
- Execute server.exe
- Execute Windows Powershell and type:
  * ./client.exe <b>your_ipaddr</b>
  * And you will receive some message like send successful...blablabla
